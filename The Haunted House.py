 # A Dictionary will have a value and a key and you will be able to 'extract the 'value from the key.  

#computer = {
#"brand": "NES",
#"model": "Blue",
#"year": 1994 }

#print computer[model]  will print 'Blue'  so in conclusion  dictionary[key] to extract the value 

# Nested Dictionary 

# You can also have a Dictionary within a Dictionary and that is called a 'Nested Dictionary 
# For example within the above game if you are if current Room is in 'Hall' and you instruct to 'go north' current Room will change to Bed Room 
# because the code currentRoom = rooms[currentRoom][move[1]]  will equate to rooms[Hall][north] and the 'value' of the nested key 'north' is 'Bed Room
# hence currentRoom becomes 'Bed Room'. So in conclusion  dictionary[key][nested key] to extract nested value
